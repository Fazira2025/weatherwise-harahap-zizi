## Prompting Techniques
While developing this application, I applied various prompting strategies, starting from problem analysis to problem-solving using Python code. This process has greatly enhanced my understanding, both conceptually and technically, while making my workflow more efficient.
I began by structuring a pseudocode outline of the program, after which I asked the AI to explain the reasoning and logical steps needed to build the application based on my pseudocode. This approach is known as Chain-of-Thought Prompting, similar to how I engaged with AI in conversation1.txt. Given my limited experience in coding, I also utilized zero-shot and few-shot prompting, asking AI to analyze my latest code version and generate a complete solution or assist in developing new logic for my program.
By applying these prompting techniques, I have become accustomed to using AI as a learning companion, helping me understand concepts, develop solutions, and strengthen my programming logic skills.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of:
Through this project, I am proud to have gained a deeper understanding of programming and successfully tackled several complex technical tasks.
- I learned how to retrieve real-time data using the wttr.in API, and I now understand how APIs present data in JSON format, which can be used to create user-friendly visualisations.
- I developed dynamic menus and location selection based on user input, making the program more practical and interactive.
- I successfully implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Weather Wise program, allowing it to better interpret and respond to user queries.
- I can now accurately display a 3-day weather forecast with an engaging and well-structured presentation.
- I have transformed Weather Wise into a decision-making tool, providing users with activity suggestions based on weather conditions in their chosen locations.

## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time and could conduct deeper research, I would like to improve the program by:
- Creating more advanced and visually appealing visualisations, such as displaying temperature and precipitation trends in graphs for the next three days. This would enhance the program's usability and aesthetics. I also plan to add a logo for Weather Wise to give it a professional touch.
- Once I develop more advanced programming skills, I aim to enhance the program by integrating voice commands for seamless interaction.
- Expanding NLP capabilities to support a wider range of user queries and responses.
- Geo-chart functionality will be added to display maps of selected locations.
- Providing weather information for nearby areas within the chosen country.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
- This project has reinforced my understanding of the Information Technology era, where technology can be harnessed to simplify daily life and foster innovation, especially in programming. AI proves to be an invaluable tool when guided thoughtfully and effectively.
- I started this unit with no prior knowledge of programming. Still, through lectures, study modules, quizzes, mini-projects, and this final project, I have built a solid foundation in key technical concepts required to develop functional programs.
- Completing this project and course has allowed me to gain a new skill, and I look forward to continuing my learning journey and innovating within the field of information technology.
