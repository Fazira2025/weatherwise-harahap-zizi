***Conversation about detecting users activity for parse_weather_question***

1.	Me: Hey. Can you help me find the word "Activities" from user input in Python?
Copilot AI said:
Certainly! If you want to search for the word "Activities" in a text input by the user in Python, you can use built-in string search methods. Here are a couple of ways you can do it:
1.	Using in to check if the word exists:
text = input("Enter text: ")  # User input

if "activities" in text.lower():  # .lower() makes the search case-insensitive
    print("The word 'activities' was found in the text!")
else:
    print("The word 'activities' was not found.")
2.	Using Regular Expressions (re):
If you want a more flexible search (e.g., to match related forms like "activity", "activities", or "doing activities"), you can use re.search():
import re

text = input("Enter text: ")
pattern = r"\bactivities\b"  # \b ensures it matches the exact word

if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):  # Case-insensitive search
    print("The word 'activities' was found in the text!")
else:
    print("The word 'activities' was not found.")

2.	Me: I have this code. How can I detect the activity that the user inputs?
def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define a regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"

    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time is "today" if not found
    time = "today"

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Get time value (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)

    # Determine the date based on the time mentioned
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the location provided earlier
    location = location_from_input

    # Display extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    # Call the function to show weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
Copilot AI said:
Your current code focuses on reading time from the user's input question.
If you want to also detect activity words from user input, you can add an extra regex pattern for activity detection.

‚úÖ Here's how to add activity detection to your function:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"
    # Regex pattern to detect activity
    activity_pattern = r"\b(activity|exercise|running|cycling|swimming|walking)\b"

    # Search for time
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    time = "today"  # Default

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    # Determine target date
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Search for activity
    activity_match = re.search(activity_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    activity = activity_match.group(1).capitalize() if activity_match else "Unknown"

    # Use the location provided
    location = location_from_input

    # Display extracted results
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    print(f"Activity: {activity}")

    # Call weather visualisation
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

# Example user input
question = "Will I be able to go running tomorrow in Sydney?"
location_from_input = "Sydney"
parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input)

In this code, I added activity detection using regex.
If the user mentions an activity like "running", "cycling", "swimming", etc., it will be detected.
You can expand the activity list as needed.

3.	Me I have this code from ChatGPT. Is this a good code?
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"

    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"

    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for an outdoor activity
    outdoor_match = re.search(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for an indoor activity
    indoor_match = re.search(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time is "today" if no match found
    time = "today"
    activity = None       # Default: no activity detected
    activity_type = None  # Default: no activity type detected

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Get time value (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)

    if outdoor_match:
        activity = outdoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Outdoor"
    elif indoor_match:
        activity = indoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Indoor"

    # Determine the target date based on the time
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the location that was previously provided
    location = location_from_input

    # Display the extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    # Display detected activity and its type
    if activity:
        print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
        print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    else:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Call the function to display weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
Copilot AI said:
This function is well-structured and effectively extracts time, activity, and location from a user's question. It‚Äôs definitely a good approach! However, I see a few areas for improvement:
‚úÖ Strengths:
1.	Regex-based extraction: It efficiently detects time and activity from user input.
2.	Categorization of activities: Differentiating between indoor and outdoor activities is useful.
3.	Default values: If no time or activity is found, sensible defaults are used (today and None).
üõ† Possible Improvements:
1.	Use word boundaries (\b) in regex patterns:
o	Without \b, words like running may match rerun, which can cause unintended results. Example:
outdoor_activities = r"\b(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)\b"
indoor_activities = r"\b(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)\b"
2.	Case Insensitivity for Activity Detection:
o	You correctly use re.IGNORECASE, but capitalizing the extracted word is more readable:
activity = outdoor_match.group(1).capitalize() if outdoor_match else indoor_match.group(1).capitalize() if indoor_match else None
3.	Handling Alternative Time Expressions:
‚Ä¢	Users might say ‚Äúday after tomorrow‚Äù or variations like ‚Äúnext Tuesday‚Äù. Expanding time detection could make it more flexible.

4.	Me: Hey, from that function, I notice that I can't input two activities. How do I input two user activities?
Copilot AI said:
Great observation! The current function only captures one activity because it uses re.search(), which finds only the first match. To allow multiple activities, you can modify the function to use re.findall(), which retrieves all matches in a list.
‚úÖ Updated function to allow multiple activity inputs:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"
    
    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities (use \b for word boundaries)
    outdoor_activities = r"\b(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)\b"
    indoor_activities = r"\b(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)\b"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Find all outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_matches = re.findall(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    indoor_matches = re.findall(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time is "today" if no match found
    time = "today"
    
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Get the time (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)
    
    # Combine all detected activities
    activities = [activity.capitalize() for activity in outdoor_matches + indoor_matches]
    activity_type = "Outdoor" if outdoor_matches else "Indoor" if indoor_matches else "Unknown"

    # Determine the target date based on the mentioned time
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the previously provided location
    location = location_from_input

    # Display the extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    # Display all detected activities
    if activities:
        print(f"Activities: {', '.join(activities)}")
        print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    else:
        print("No specific activities mentioned.")

    # Call the function to display weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

# Example user input
question = "Can I go hiking and swimming tomorrow in Sydney?"
location_from_input = "Sydney"
parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input)

üî• Improvements in this version:
‚úÖ Captures multiple activities using re.findall()
‚úÖ Capitalizes activities for better readability
‚úÖ Handles multiple matches without overwriting previous ones
‚úÖ Determines activity type dynamically
Now, your function will correctly detect multiple activities from a user input! üéâ Let me know if you want any refinements! üöÄ

***Conversation about error handling for users' input on parse_weather_question*** 

5.	Me: Okay. But what if the user inputs some activities that don't exist in the dictionary? How to do the error-handling?
Copilot AI said:
Great question! If a user inputs an activity that isn't in the predefined dictionary, there are several ways to handle it gracefully:
‚úÖ Error Handling Approaches:
1.	Allow unknown activities & notify the user
o	If an activity isn't in the predefined list, acknowledge it but still process the request.
2.	Suggest closest matches
o	Use fuzzy matching (difflib.get_close_matches()) to suggest possible activities.
3.	Ask for clarification
‚Ä¢	If no matches are found, prompt the user to either confirm or re-enter the activity.
üî•Improved Code with Error Handling
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Example user input

location_from_input = "Sydney"
parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input)

6.	Me: I notice an error when the user inputs after-tomorrow, such as after tomorrow. So, how to read all users input?
Copilot AI said:
Great catch! The issue comes from how re.search() is looking for exact matches of "after-tomorrow", but some users might write "after tomorrow" with a space. To fix this, we can adjust the regex pattern to handle variations like "after tomorrow", "tomorrow after", or "day after tomorrow".

‚úÖ Improved Time Parsing
Here‚Äôs an updated version that makes the time detection more flexible

    # Default to "today" if no time is found
    time = "today"

    if time_match:
        raw_time = time_match.group(0).lower()
        
        # Normalize variations
        if "after" in raw_time:

üî• What‚Äôs Improved?
‚úÖ Handles both "after-tomorrow" and "after tomorrow"
‚úÖ Supports "day after tomorrow" and other variations
‚úÖ Avoids errors by normalizing the input before processing
Now your function will correctly interpret all user inputs related to "after tomorrow"! üöÄ Let me know if you need further tweaks. üòÉ

7.	Me: Can you make a change in this function?
if time == "tomorrow":

Copilot AI said:
Absolutely! If you want a more flexible approach, you could allow users to specify any number of days ahead, rather than just "tomorrow" or "after-tomorrow". Here‚Äôs an improved version that reads "in X days" dynamically:
