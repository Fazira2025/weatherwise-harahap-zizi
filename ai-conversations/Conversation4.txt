***Conversation about #Define get_weather_data() function with API in JSON format***

1.	Me: Hi there, so I have this API link, but in text format. Can I have the API in JSON format? Because I need to copy the data value. Since I notice that with this code, I can only display the figures. This is my code. def get_weather_data(location): try: url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}' response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status() print(response.text) except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}')
Claude said:
Yes! The wttr.in API does support JSON output, which will make it much easier to extract specific weather data values. You can get JSON output by adding the format=j1 parameter to your URL.
Here's how you can modify your function to get and parse JSON data:
import requests
import json

def get_weather_data(location):
    """Get weather data from wttr.in in JSON format"""
    try:
        # Add format=j1 to get JSON response
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Parse the JSON response
        weather_data = response.json()
        
        # Return the parsed data instead of printing it
        return weather_data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')
    except json.JSONDecodeError as jerr:
        print(f'JSON Decode Error: {jerr}')
    
    return None

def display_weather(weather_data):
    """Display formatted weather information from the JSON data"""
    if not weather_data:
        print("No weather data available.")
        return
    
    # Extract current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    location = weather_data['nearest_area'][0]['areaName'][0]['value']
    country = weather_data['nearest_area'][0]['country'][0]['value']
    
    # Display current weather
    print(f"\nCurrent Weather for {location}, {country}")
    print(f"Temperature: {current['temp_C']}°C ({current['temp_F']}°F)")
    print(f"Feels Like: {current['FeelsLikeC']}°C ({current['FeelsLikeF']}°F)")
    print(f"Weather: {current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']}")
    print(f"Humidity: {current['humidity']}%")
    print(f"Wind: {current['windspeedKmph']} km/h, {current['winddir16Point']}")
    
    # Display forecast for the next few days
    print("\nForecast:")
    for day in weather_data['weather']:
        date = day['date']
        max_temp = day['maxtempC']
        min_temp = day['mintempC']
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day forecast
        
        print(f"{date}: {min_temp}°C to {max_temp}°C, {weather_desc}")

def get_current_temperature(weather_data):
    """Extract current temperature in Celsius from weather data"""
    if weather_data and 'current_condition' in weather_data:
        return int(weather_data['current_condition'][0]['temp_C'])
    return None

def get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, day_index=0):
    """Extract forecast temperature for a specific day (0=today, 1=tomorrow, etc.)"""
    if weather_data and 'weather' in weather_data and day_index < len(weather_data['weather']):
        return int(weather_data['weather'][day_index]['maxtempC'])
    return None

def suggest_activities(temperature):
    """Suggest activities based on temperature"""
    if temperature is None:
        return ["Unable to determine temperature for activity suggestions."]
    
    if temperature <= 0:
        return [
            "Indoor ice skating",
            "Visit a museum or art gallery",
            "Enjoy hot cocoa at a local café",
            "Movie marathon at home"
        ]
    elif 1 <= temperature <= 10:
        return [
            "Hiking (dress warmly)",
            "Visit a local brewery", 
            "Shopping at indoor malls",
            "Winter photography"
        ]
    elif 11 <= temperature <= 20:
        return [
            "Cycling or mountain biking",
            "Picnic in the park",
            "Outdoor sightseeing",
            "Zoo or botanical garden visit"
        ]
    elif 21 <= temperature <= 30:
        return [
            "Beach visit or swimming",
            "Water sports (kayaking, paddle boarding)",
            "Outdoor dining",
            "Visit local farmers' markets"
        ]
    else:  # temperature > 30
        return [
            "Swimming or water parks",
            "Indoor activities with air conditioning",
            "Visit a shopping mall", 
            "Early morning or evening walks"
        ]
Now you can use these functions in your main menu:
def main():
    location = "London"  # Default location
    weather_data = None
    
    while True:
        print("\n==== WEATHER WISE APP ====")

        print(f'1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast at {location}')
        print(f'2. Activities Suggestions at {location} (Today, Tomorrow, Day After Tomorrow)')
        print('3. Check Other Location ')
        print('4. Exit Program ')
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
            display_weather(weather_data)
        elif choice == '2':
            if not weather_data:
                weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
            
            if weather_data:
                print(f"\n--- ACTIVITY SUGGESTIONS FOR {location.upper()} ---")
                
                # Get today's temperature
                today_temp = get_current_temperature(weather_data)
                print(f"\nToday - Temperature: {today_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(today_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
                
                # Get tomorrow's temperature
                tomorrow_temp = get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, 0)
                print(f"\nTomorrow - Temperature: {tomorrow_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(tomorrow_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
                
                # Get day after tomorrow's temperature
                day_after_temp = get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, 1)
                print(f"\nDay After Tomorrow - Temperature: {day_after_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(day_after_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to get weather data for {location}")
        elif choice == '3':
            location = input("Enter new location: ")
            print(f"Location updated to {location}")
            weather_data = None  # Reset weather data for new location
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Thank you for using Weather Wise App. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This approach:

Gets weather data in JSON format which is much easier to work with
Extracts temperatures and other data directly from the structured JSON
Provides functions to display weather and suggest activities
Reuses weather data when possible to avoid unnecessary API calls

With this JSON-based approach, you'll be able to easily access specific weather values like temperature, conditions, humidity, etc., making your activity suggestions more accurate and your code more maintainable.

2.	Me: I'm confused. I already have the API for text, now you suggest the API in JSON format, but I just have function to get API link. Can you combine it?
Your code: def get_weather_data(location): """Get weather data from wttr.in in JSON format""" try: # Add format=j1 to get JSON response url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1' response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status() # Parse the JSON response weather_data = response.json() # Return the parsed data instead of printing it return weather_data except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}') except json.JSONDecodeError as jerr: print(f'JSON Decode Error: {jerr}') return None
My code: def get_weather_data(location): try: url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}' response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status() print(response.text) except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}')
Claude said:
I understand your confusion. You want to keep your existing text-based API function while also having the ability to get the JSON data when needed. Let's create a solution that gives you both options:
import requests
import json

def get_weather_data(location, format_type="text"):
    """
    Get weather data from wttr.in
    
    Parameters:
    - location: The location to get weather for
    - format_type: 'text' for ASCII art or 'json' for JSON data
    
    Returns:
    - For text format: None (prints directly)
    - For JSON format: The parsed JSON data
    """
    try:
        # Set URL based on format type
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
        else:  # default to text
            url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
            
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            # Parse and return the JSON response
            return response.json()
        else:
            # Print the text response as you were doing before
            print(response.text)
            return None
            
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')
    except json.JSONDecodeError as jerr:
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            print(f'JSON Decode Error: {jerr}')
    
    return None

Now you can use this function in two ways:
1.	For text display (just like your original function):
get_weather_data("London")  # Prints ASCII art weather
2.	For getting JSON data to use in your code:
weather_data = get_weather_data("London", format_type="json")
This approach:
1.	Keeps your original functionality intact - option 1 displays the ASCII art weather just like before
2.	Adds new functionality using JSON data to suggest activities in option 2
3.	Uses a single, flexible function that can handle both formats
4.	Maintains all your error handling
Does this combined approach work better for your needs?

3.	Me: Thankyou, I did it. I want to ask, if I want to display API text, do I have to change something in this function?
if choice == "1": get_weather_data(location)
Claude said:
Your function is perfect as it is! When you call get_weather_data(location) without specifying a format type, it defaults to "text" format, which is exactly what you want for displaying the ASCII art weather.
Let's double-check the relevant parts of the function to confirm:
def get_weather_data(location, format_type="text"):
    # ...
    if format_type.lower() == "json":
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
    else:  # default to text
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
    
    # ...
    if format_type.lower() == "json":
        # Parse and return the JSON response
        return response.json()
    else:
        # Print the text response as you were doing before
        print(response.text)
        return None
    # ...
So when you call:
if choice == "1":
    get_weather_data(location)
Since you're not specifying a format_type parameter, it uses the default value of "text". This means it will:
1.	Use the URL without the ?format=j1 parameter
2.	Print the response text directly (the ASCII art weather)
3.	Return None
This is exactly what you want for option 1 - it matches your original function's behavior.
For option 2, you're explicitly calling it with format_type="json":
weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
This way, you get the structured JSON data to work with for activity suggestions.
So you don't need to change anything - your code is working exactly as intended! The function handles both cases perfectly.

***Conversation about display temperature and the weather visualisation***

4.	Me: Okaay... now can you please teach me how to extract JSON from function get_weather_data to this function create_temperature_visualisation, because I need to display temperature and the weather with visualisation.
Sorry, I only want to display this information: Minimal Temperature Maximal Temperature Average Temperature Date Weather (raining, sunny)
I don't need it to be a graphic visualization.
Claude said:
Absolutely! Let's create a simpler function that just displays the key information you specified: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, date, and weather condition. This will be a straightforward text display without any graphics:
def display_temperature_info(location):
    """
    Display key temperature information for a location:
    - Minimum Temperature
    - Maximum Temperature 
    - Average Temperature
    - Date
    - Weather Condition
    """
    # Get the weather data in JSON format
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return
    
    print(f"\n===== TEMPERATURE INFORMATION FOR {location.upper()} =====")
    
    # Get current date
    from datetime import datetime
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
    
    # Current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    current_temp = int(current['temp_C'])
    current_weather = current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
    
    # Today's forecast information
    today_forecast = weather_data['weather'][0]
    min_temp = int(today_forecast['mintempC'])
    max_temp = int(today_forecast['maxtempC'])
    
    # Calculate average temperature (simple average of min and max)
    avg_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2
    
    # Display information
    print(f"\nDate: {current_date}")
    print(f"Current Weather: {current_weather}")
    print(f"Current Temperature: {current_temp}°C")
    print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
    print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
    print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    print("\n=== FORECAST FOR NEXT 3 DAYS ===")
    
    # Show forecast for next few days
    for i, day in enumerate(weather_data['weather']):
        if i == 0:  # Skip today as we already showed it
            continue
        
        date_str = day['date']
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")
        
        min_temp = int(day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day weather
        
        print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    print("\n" + "=" * 50)

You can add this to your menu system:
def main():
    location = "London"  # Default location
    
    while True:
        print("\n==== WEATHER WISE APP ====")
        print('Please enter your choice (1 - 5):')
        print(f'1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast at {location}')
        print(f'2. Activities Suggestions at {location} (Today, Tomorrow, Day After Tomorrow)')
        print(f'3. Temperature Information for {location}')
        print(f'4. Check Other Location ')
        print(f'5. Exit Program ')
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            get_weather_data(location)
        elif choice == '2':
            show_activities_for_location(location)
        elif choice == '3':
            display_temperature_info(location)
        elif choice == '4':
            location = input("Enter new location: ")
            print(f"Location updated to {location}")
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Thank you for using Weather Wise App. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

This function:
1.	Gets the weather data in JSON format
2.	Extracts and displays the current date, weather condition, and temperature
3.	Shows the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for today
4.	Shows the same information for the next few days in the forecast
The output is clean, text-based, and includes all the specific information you requested without any graphical elements. It's simple but provides all the essential temperature and weather condition data in an easy-to-read format.

***Conversation about creating weather emojis***

Day 3 - 12/05/2025

5.	Me: Thankyou. Now, I really want to add some emojis according to the weather. Such as raining, cloudy, sunny, thunder, snowing, etc. Can you please make it? I think we should use the if function
Claude said:
Adding weather emojis is a great idea! Let's create a function that returns an appropriate emoji based on the weather description. We'll use conditional statements to match weather keywords and return the corresponding emoji:
def get_weather_emoji(weather_description):
    """Return an emoji based on the weather description"""
    weather_lower = weather_description.lower()
    
    # Rain conditions
    if any(word in weather_lower for word in ['rain', 'drizzle', 'shower']):
        if 'thunder' in weather_lower or 'storm' in weather_lower:
            return '⛈️'  # Thunderstorm
        elif 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower:
            return '🌦️'  # Sun behind rain cloud
        else:
            return '🌧️'  # Rain cloud
    
    # Snow conditions
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in ['snow', 'blizzard', 'sleet', 'ice']):
        if 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower:
            return '🌨️'  # Snow cloud
        else:
            return '❄️'  # Snowflake
    
    # Cloud conditions
    elif 'fog' in weather_lower or 'mist' in weather_lower:
        return '🌫️'  # Fog
    elif 'overcast' in weather_lower:
        return '☁️'  # Cloud
    elif 'cloud' in weather_lower:
        if 'partly' in weather_lower or 'scattered' in weather_lower:
            return '⛅'  # Sun behind cloud
        else:
            return '☁️'  # Cloud
    
    # Clear conditions
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in ['sunny', 'clear', 'fair']):
        return '☀️'  # Sun
    
    # Wind conditions
    elif 'wind' in weather_lower or 'gale' in weather_lower or 'storm' in weather_lower:
        return '💨'  # Wind blowing
    
    # Default
    else:
        return '🌡️'  # Thermometer (default)

Now let's modify your create_temperature_visualisation function to include these emojis:
def create_temperature_visualisation(location):
    from datetime import datetime
    
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return
    
    print(f"\n===== TEMPERATURE INFORMATION FOR {location.upper()} =====")
    
    # Get current date
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
    
    # Current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    current_temp = int(current['temp_C'])
    current_weather = current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']

The changes I made:
1.	Added the new get_weather_emoji() function that analyzes the weather description and returns an appropriate emoji
2.	Modified your visualization function to get the emoji for the current weather
3.	Added the emoji to each forecast day as well
This will add visual cues next to the weather descriptions throughout your app. The emojis make the output more intuitive and visually appealing while maintaining a simple text-based interface.
A few notes:
1.	The function uses keyword matching, so it should work with most weather descriptions from the API
2.	The order of conditions is important (e.g., checking for "thunderstorm" before "rain")
3.	If no matching condition is found, it defaults to a thermometer emoji
If you find any weather conditions that don't match well with the current implementation, you can easily add more conditions to the get_weather_emoji() function.

Let me fix the indentation for your create_temperature_visualisation function:
python
def create_temperature_visualisation(location):
    # Import needed at the top of your file
    from datetime import datetime
    
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")

    # Current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    current_temp = int(current['temp_C'])
    current_weather = current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
    
    # Today's forecast information
    today_forecast = weather_data['weather'][0]

The key issues I fixed:
1.	The indentation after the return statement was incorrect - everything was indented too far
2.	Added an import for datetime at the top of the function (you'll also want to add this at the top of your file)
3.	Maintained consistent 4-space indentation throughout the function
Make sure to also add the import at the top of your file:
