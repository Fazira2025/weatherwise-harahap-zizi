***Conversation about displaying a menu using print***

1.	Me: Hi there. So, actually, I have to make a weatherwise assignment through programming - coding. Now I want to make a menu in the main functions. Can you please tell me simple Python code examples for displaying a menu with print()?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a simple Python code example to display a menu using print():
python
Copy
def display_menu():
    print("Weatherwise Assignment Menu")
    print("1. Check current weather")
    print("2. View weather forecast")
    print("3. Exit")

def main():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = input("Please enter your choice (1-3): ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            print("You chose to check the current weather.")
            # You can add your weather-checking code here
        elif choice == '2':
            print("You chose to view the weather forecast.")
            # Add your forecast code here
        elif choice == '3':
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
1.	The display_menu() function prints the options to the user.
2.	The main() function runs an infinite loop (while True) to display the menu continuously until the user chooses to exit (choice == '3').
3.	The user input is taken using input(), and based on the input, a corresponding action is performed.
4.	If the user inputs something invalid, it asks them to try again.
This is a basic structure for implementing a simple text-based menu. You can expand this by adding actual functionality for each option, such as checking the weather.

2.	Me: How can I make a line separator in Python?
ChatGPT said:
In Python, you can create a line separator using the print() function to display a specific character or sequence of characters to separate sections in your output. Here are a few examples:
1. Using Hyphens (-)
python
Copy
print("-" * 50)  # Creates a line with 50 hyphens
2. Using Equal Signs (=)
python
Copy
print("=" * 50)  # Creates a line with 50 equal signs
3. Using Dashes with Custom Length
You can change the number inside the * to adjust the length of the separator:
python
Copy
print("-" * 30)  # Creates a line with 30 dashes
4. Using Custom Text or Symbols
If you prefer a custom separator, you can do something like:
python
Copy
print("~" * 40)  # Creates a line with 40 tildes
Example in Context:
python
Copy
def display_menu():
    print("Weatherwise Assignment Menu")
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator
    print("1. Check current weather")
    print("2. View weather forecast")
    print("3. Exit")
    print("-" * 50)  # Another line separator

# Call the function
display_menu()
This would print the menu with line separators before and after the menu options for better readability. You can replace the "-" with any other character or string to suit your style.

3.	Me: What if I want to say this before the main menu? Hello! Welcome to Weather Wise. How can I help you? I must use print() right?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use print() to display the greeting message before showing the main menu. Here's how you can integrate it:
python
Copy
def display_menu():
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator
    print("Weatherwise Assignment Menu")
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator
    print("1. Check current weather")
    print("2. View weather forecast")
    print("3. Exit")
    print("-" * 50)  # Another line separator
def main():
    print("Hello! Welcome to Weather Wise. How can I help you?")
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator before the main menu
    display_menu()
    
    while True:
        choice = input("Please enter your choice (1-3): ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            print("You chose to check the current weather.")
            # Add your weather-checking code here
        elif choice == '2':
            print("You chose to view the weather forecast.")
            # Add your forecast code here
        elif choice == '3':
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
1.	The print("Hello! Welcome to Weather Wise. How can I help you?") displays the greeting message at the start.
2.	The print("-" * 50) creates a line separator for better organization.
3.	The display_menu() function is then called to show the options.
4.	The rest of the program proceeds as usual with the menu options and input handling.
This will display the greeting message, followed by a separator line, and then the main menu.

4.	Me: Can I ask for the user's name? How to do it in Python?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can ask for the user's name in Python using the input() function. Here's how you can ask for the user's name and display a personalized greeting:
python
Copy
def display_menu():
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator
    print("Weatherwise Assignment Menu")
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator
    print("1. Check current weather")
    print("2. View weather forecast")
    print("3. Exit")
    print("-" * 50)  # Another line separator

def main():
    # Ask for the user's name
    name = input("What is your name? ")

    # Greet the user by name
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Weather Wise. How can I help you?")
    print("-" * 50)  # Line separator before the main menu
    
    display_menu()
    
    while True:
        choice = input("Please enter your choice (1-3): ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            print(f"{name}, you chose to check the current weather.")
            # Add your weather-checking code here
        elif choice == '2':
            print(f"{name}, you chose to view the weather forecast.")
            # Add your forecast code here
        elif choice == '3':
            print("Exiting the program.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How it works:
1.	Asking for the user's name: The line name = input("What is your name? ") prompts the user to enter their name.
2.	Personalized greeting: The greeting print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Weather Wise. How can I help you?") uses the user's input to personalize the message.
3.	Using the name in the menu: Inside the menu options, the user's name is included in the response, like print(f"{name}, you chose to check the current weather.").
This will prompt the user for their name, greet them accordingly, and then continue with the menu options.

***Conversation about connecting to API from wttr.in***

1.	Me: hey, so I want to connect to API from https://wttr.in/ I got this from my professor's module. How to sync it? Where should I put the link to? import requests try: response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data') response.raise_for_status() except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}')  
ChatGPT said:
To sync with the API from https://wttr.in/, you'll need to modify the requests.get() URL to point to the correct API endpoint. In your case, the URL for wttr.in would be something like https://wttr.in/?format=%C (for weather information, for example). Here's how you can modify the code:

import requests
try:
    # Update this line with the correct URL for wttr.in API
    response = requests.get('https://wttr.in/?format=%C')  # You can adjust the format as needed
    response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an error for invalid status codes
    print(response.text)  # Print the response text (weather info)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
    print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
    print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
    print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print(f'Error: {err}')
Key changes:
•	API URL: Replace 'https://api.example.com/data' with https://wttr.in/?format=%C (or any other endpoint you prefer based on the wttr.in API format options).
•	Response Handling: The response from the API is printed using response.text.
Make sure to check the API documentation of wttr.in to adjust the format or parameters if needed.
Let me know if you need further adjustments or details!

2.	Me: Hey, I think you got it wrong, because the https://wttr.in/?format=%C is an error. I just need the main display of https://wttr.in/. Can you please make it correct?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the corrected code:
import requests
try:
    # Update this line to fetch the main display from wttr.in
    response = requests.get('https://wttr.in/')
    response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an error for invalid status codes
    print(response.text)  # Print the weather info from the main display
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
    print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
    print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
    print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
    print(f'Error: {err}')
Key points:
•	URL: https://wttr.in/ will display the weather information directly, as seen in the main display on the website.
•	Response Handling: response.text will show the main weather info from wttr.in.

***Conversation about categorising weather conditions in similar words for users*** 

1.	Me: heyy I have this function. def get_weather_emoji(weather_description): """Return an emoji based on the weather description""" weather_lower = weather_description.lower() # Rain conditions if any(word in weather_lower for word in ['rain', 'drizzle', 'shower']): if 'thunder' in weather_lower or 'storm' in weather_lower: return '⛈️' # Thunderstorm elif 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower: return '🌦️' # Sun behind rain cloud else: return '🌧️' # Rain cloud # Snow conditions elif any(word in weather_lower for word in ['snow', 'blizzard', 'sleet', 'ice']): if 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower: return '🌨️' # Snow cloud else: return '❄️' # Snowflake # Cloud conditions elif 'fog' in weather_lower or 'mist' in weather_lower: return '🌫️' # Fog elif 'overcast' in weather_lower: return '☁️' # Cloud elif 'cloud' in weather_lower: if 'partly' in weather_lower or 'scattered' in weather_lower: return '⛅' # Sun behind cloud else: return '☁️' # Cloud # Clear conditions elif any(word in weather_lower for word in ['sunny', 'clear', 'fair']): return '☀️' # Sun # Wind conditions elif 'wind' in weather_lower or 'gale' in weather_lower or 'storm' in weather_lower: return '💨' # Wind blowing # Default else: return '🌡️' # Thermometer (default) 
Can you be more specific? Like, put all the similar words under the specific weather conditions. Such as " 🌡️ Thundery outbreaks in nearby " can be included as thunder or storm
ChatGPT said:
Sure! I can refactor your function to categorize weather conditions with more specific terms, grouping similar words under each weather condition. This will make it easier to recognize various weather descriptions, such as "thundery outbreaks" under thunder or storm conditions.
Here’s the updated version of the function:
python
Copy
def get_weather_emoji(weather_description):
    """Return an emoji based on the weather description"""
    weather_lower = weather_description.lower()

    # Define specific keywords for each weather condition
    rain_keywords = ['rain', 'drizzle', 'shower', 'thundery outbreaks', 'downpour', 'wet']
    snow_keywords = ['snow', 'blizzard', 'sleet', 'ice', 'hail', 'flurry']
    cloud_keywords = ['cloud', 'overcast', 'mist', 'fog', 'haze', 'partly cloudy', 'scattered clouds']
    sun_keywords = ['sunny', 'clear', 'fair', 'hot', 'bright', 'clear skies', 'clear weather']
    wind_keywords = ['wind', 'gale', 'storm', 'breeze', 'gust']

    # Rain conditions
    if any(word in weather_lower for word in rain_keywords):
        if 'thunder' in weather_lower or 'storm' in weather_lower or 'thundery outbreaks' in weather_lower:
            return '⛈️'  # Thunderstorm
        elif 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower:
            return '🌦️'  # Sun behind rain cloud
        else:
            return '🌧️'  # Rain cloud
    
    # Snow conditions
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in snow_keywords):
        if 'light' in weather_lower or 'patchy' in weather_lower:
            return '🌨️'  # Snow cloud
        else:
            return '❄️'  # Snowflake
    
    # Cloud conditions
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in cloud_keywords):
        if 'fog' in weather_lower or 'mist' in weather_lower:
            return '🌫️'  # Fog
        elif 'overcast' in weather_lower:
            return '☁️'  # Cloudy weather
        elif 'partly' in weather_lower or 'scattered' in weather_lower:
            return '⛅'  # Sun behind cloud
        else:
            return '☁️'  # Cloud
    
    # Clear conditions (sunny/fair weather)
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in sun_keywords):
        return '☀️'  # Sun
    
    # Wind conditions
    elif any(word in weather_lower for word in wind_keywords):
        return '💨'  # Wind blowing
    
    # Default (unknown or undefined weather)
    else:
        return '🌡️'  # Thermometer (default)
Key Changes:
1.	Grouped Keywords:
o	I’ve grouped the similar weather terms like "rain", "snow", "cloud", "sun", and "wind" under specific variables like rain_keywords, snow_keywords, etc. This makes it easier to manage and add new weather conditions.
2.	Thundery Outbreaks:
o	"Thundery outbreaks" is now included under the thunderstorm condition, so the emoji for thunderstorms will be returned when that keyword is found in the weather description.
3.	Clearer Keyword Matching:
o	Each weather condition now has its specific group of keywords, making the logic more specific and precise.
With this update, the function will better categorize a wider range of weather descriptions, including variations like "thundery outbreaks" for storms, and "flurry" for light snow, etc.

***Conversation about NLP ***

1.	Me: I want to make a parse question using NLP in my program. Please tell me more about this.
ChatGPT said:
Parsing a question using NLP (Natural Language Processing) involves analyzing a user's input, typically a question, to extract meaningful information such as the intent, entities, or relevant context. This can help your program understand the structure and intent behind the input, enabling it to provide a more accurate and appropriate response.
Here's a breakdown of how you can implement question parsing using NLP:
Steps for Parsing Questions in NLP:
1.	Text Preprocessing:
o	Tokenization: Split the input question into individual words or tokens.
o	Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
o	Removing stopwords: Remove common words like "the", "is", "on", which do not add significant meaning.
o	Punctuation removal: Remove unnecessary punctuation marks, as they often don't contribute to the meaning.
2.	Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS):
o	Assign tags to each token, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. This helps the model understand the grammatical structure of the sentence, which is crucial for identifying the subject, verb, and object in a question.
3.	Named Entity Recognition (NER):
o	Identify and extract named entities like dates, locations, organizations, or persons mentioned in the question. For example, in the question "What is the weather in Paris tomorrow?" "Paris" is a named entity.
4.	Dependency Parsing:
o	Analyze the grammatical structure to determine the relationships between words (e.g., which word is the subject, object, or modifier). This helps the program understand how different parts of the sentence are related to each other.
5.	Intent Detection:
o	Identify the user's intent behind the question (e.g., informational, command, clarification). This is often done using pre-trained models that classify questions into categories.
6.	Response Generation:
o	After parsing the question, generate the appropriate response based on the identified intent and entities. This might involve querying a database, calling an API, or simply responding with a predefined answer.
Example Workflow:
Let's take the question: "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"
1.	Tokenization:
o	["What", "is", "the", "weather", "in", "Perth", "tomorrow"]
2.	POS Tagging:
o	[("What", "WDT"), ("is", "VBZ"), ("the", "DT"), ("weather", "NN"), ("in", "IN"), ("Perth", "NNP"), ("tomorrow", "NN")]
3.	NER:
o	Entities: Location: "Perth", Time: "tomorrow"
4.	Dependency Parsing:
o	"What" is the question word.
o	"Weather" is the main noun (subject).
o	"Perth" is the location.
o	"Tomorrow" indicates the time when the weather is being asked about.
5.	Intent Detection:
o	The intent of the question is informational, specifically about the weather in a specific location and time.
6.	Response Generation:
o	Using an API or a weather dataset, the program fetches the weather information for Perth tomorrow and generates a response like: "The weather in Perth tomorrow is sunny with a high of 22°C."
Tools and Libraries for NLP in Python:
1.	spaCy: A popular NLP library that supports tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and more.
o	spaCy documentation
2.	NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A comprehensive library for NLP tasks, including text preprocessing, POS tagging, and more.
o	NLTK documentation
3.	Transformers (by Hugging Face): Pre-trained models for more advanced NLP tasks, including question answering, intent detection, etc.
o	Transformers documentation
4.	TextBlob: A simpler library for common NLP tasks like noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and translation.
o	TextBlob documentation
Example Code Using spaCy:
Here’s a simple example using spaCy to parse a question:
import spacy

# Load the spaCy model for English
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Define the question
question = "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"

# Process the text
doc = nlp(question)

# Tokenize and POS tagging
for token in doc:
    print(f"{token.text} -> {token.pos_}")

# Named Entity Recognition
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(f"Entity: {ent.text}, Label: {ent.label_}")

# Dependency parsing
for token in doc:
    print(f"Token: {token.text}, Head: {token.head.text}, Dep: {token.dep_}")

        print("\n" + "=" * 50)
ChatGPT said:
Certainly! To create the parse_weather_question() function, our goal is to process a user’s weather question by extracting information such as location and date (today, tomorrow, or day after tomorrow). Then, we will use that information to direct the weather request to the function you already made, create_temperature_visualisation().
Here is an example implementation of the parse_weather_question() function:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question):
    # Define regex patterns to detect location and time
    location_pattern = r"(in|at)\s([a-zA-Z\s]+)"
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|day after tomorrow)"
    
    # Search for location in the question
    location_match = re.search(location_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Default location to None and time to "today"
    location = None
    time = "today"
    
    if location_match:
        location = location_match.group(2).strip()
    
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    # Determine target date based on the time mentioned
    target_date = datetime.now()
    
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "day after tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Display extracted results

    # Call the function to show weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

# Example usage
question = "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"
parse_weather_question(question)


Explanation:
1.	Location Extraction:
Uses regex to find keywords "in" or "at" followed by a location name. The location is extracted as the word(s) after "in" or "at".
2.	Time Extraction:
Uses regex to find words like "today", "tomorrow", or "day after tomorrow". If no time is mentioned, the default is "today".
3.	Target Date:
Based on the detected time (e.g., "tomorrow"), the target date is calculated accordingly by adding days to the current date.
4.	Calling create_temperature_visualisation(location):
Once location and time are extracted, the function calls your existing weather visualization function, passing the extracted location.
Input:
question = "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"
parse_weather_question(question)
Output:
Location: Perth
Time: Tomorrow
Target Date: Tuesday, 15 May 2025

3.	Me: Should I replace this part to call the new function?
elif choice == "2": create_temperature_visualisation(location)
ChatGPT said:
Yes, if you want to use the new parse_weather_question() function, you should replace the part that calls create_temperature_visualisation(location) with a call to parse_weather_question(question).
You can replace it with:
elif choice == "2":
    # Get weather question input from the user
    question = input("Enter your weather question: ")
    # Call the function to parse the weather question
    parse_weather_question(question)
    # Panggil fungsi untuk parse pertanyaan cuaca
    parse_weather_question(question)

4.	Me: Why is the location not detected? Here is my code output:
🤖: Hi! Please input your question: Perth tomorrow Location: None Time: Tomorrow Target Date: Wednesday, 14 May 2025 Please provide a valid location. I already input the location here:
def main(): name = input('🤖: Hi! Please enter your name: ') location = input(f'🤖: Which location would you like to check, {name}? ')
ChatGPT said:
The problem occurs because you are taking a separate input for location inside your main() function, but then trying to parse a full weather question inside parse_weather_question(). Basically, the input in main() (e.g., "Perth tomorrow") is not correctly passed into parse_weather_question().
Cause:
•	In main(), you ask the user for the location only (e.g., "Perth").
•	But parse_weather_question() expects a full question including location and time (like "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?") so it can extract both location and time using regex.
•	Your regex expects phrases like "in Perth" or "at Perth" to find the location, but if your input is just "Perth tomorrow" (without "in" or "at"), it doesn’t match the regex, so location becomes None.
Solution:
1.	Change your input to make sure the full weather question is given to parse_weather_question().
2.	Make sure the location input and time input are combined properly into a full question string that includes the keywords regex expects.
def main():
    # Ask for user's name
    name = input('🤖: Hi! Please enter your name: ')

    # Ask for location and time separately
    location = input(f'🤖: Which location would you like to check, {name}? ')
    time = input(f'🤖: When would you like to know the weather, {name}? (today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow) ')

    # Combine location and time into a full question string
    question = f"What is the weather in {location} {time}?"

    # Call the parsing function with the full question
    parse_weather_question(question)


def parse_weather_question(question):
    import re
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    # Regex patterns for detecting location and time
    location_pattern = r"(in|at)\s([a-zA-Z\s]+)"
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|day after tomorrow)"

    location_match = re.search(location_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    location = None
    time = "today"

    if location_match:
        location = location_match.group(2).strip()

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    target_date = datetime.now()
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "day after tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    if location:

***Conversation about parsing function***  

5.	Me: But previously, the user had already entered the location. Can the question parsing function read the location that was already input? Please modify the parsing code.
ChatGPT said:
Ah, now I understand that the location has already been entered by the user earlier in main(), and you want the parse_weather_question() function to directly use that location without requiring location input again.
Problem:
•	Previously, parse_weather_question() tried to find location by regex from the question text, but if the input is something like "Perth tomorrow" without keywords like "in" or "at", regex won’t capture the location.
Solution:
Modify parse_weather_question() so that:
1.	It uses the location passed from the earlier user input.
2.	It still detects the time (like "today", "tomorrow") via regex.
3.	It no longer needs to get location from the question text if it’s already provided.
Modified Code:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Function to process weather question
def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|day after tomorrow)"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"
    
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Extract time (today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow)

    # Calculate target date based on time
    target_date = datetime.now()
    
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "day after tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the location that was already input
    location = location_from_input

    # Display extracted info
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Call function to show weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

# Main function to get user input
def main():
    name = input('🤖: Hi! Please enter your name: ')
    
    # Ask for location
    location_from_input = input(f'🤖: Which location would you like to check, {name}? ')
    
    # Ask for time
    question_time = input(f'🤖: When would you like to know the weather, {name}? (today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow) ')
    
    # Combine location and time into one question string
    question = f"What is the weather in {location_from_input} {question_time}?"
    
    # Call parsing function with question and location separately
    parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input)

# Function for weather visualization
def create_temperature_visualisation(location):
    print(f"Visualizing weather for {location}...")
    # Logic to visualize weather (e.g., show weather data)

# Run the main program
main()
Explanation of changes:
1.	Passing location_from_input to parse_weather_question:
Now, parse_weather_question() does not try to extract location from the question string but uses the location given earlier in main().
2.	Time detection remains via regex:
The function still detects "today", "tomorrow", or "day after tomorrow" from the question string.
3.	Direct use of previously input location:
The location input by the user earlier is used directly for weather visualization, so there is no need to extract it from the question again.

***Conversation about parse_weather_question***

1.	Me: Hey. Can you help me find the word "activities" from input in Python?
ChatGPT said:
Certainly! To find a certain word or activity in an input string in Python, you can use methods like the in keyword or regular expressions. Here’s an example of how to do it:
input_text = "I am learning Python and looking for an interesting activity."
search_word = "activity"

if search_word in input_text:
    print(f'The word "{search_word}" was found in the input.')
else:
    print(f'The word "{search_word}" was not found in the input.')
Using Regular Expressions:
If you want more flexible searching (for example, searching for variations of the word or using specific patterns), you can use the re module (regular expressions).
Using in:
If you want to search for a specific word in a string, you can use in to check whether the word exists in the input.
import re

input_text = "I am learning Python and looking for an interesting activity."
search_word = "activity"

if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(search_word) + r'\b', input_text):
    print(f'The word "{search_word}" was found in the input.')
else:
    print(f'The word "{search_word}" was not found in the input.')

2.	Me: I have this code. How can I read the activity input by the user?
def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"

    # Search for time in question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    # Determine date based on the time mentioned
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the location already provided
    location = location_from_input

    # Print extracted info
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    # Call function to display weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
ChatGPT said:
How to read the activity input by the user?
To read the activity entered by the user in your Python code, you need to add logic to detect keywords or phrases indicating the activity being asked. This can be done by adding detection of activity keywords in the input using regular expressions (regex) or simple keyword search.
If you want to add the ability to capture activity words in the question, you can define a regex pattern that looks for certain weather-related activities like "rain", "sunny", "cloudy", etc.
Example of modified code to capture activity words (weather activities):
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Regex pattern for time detection
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"
    # Regex pattern for activity detection (example weather-related words)
    activity_pattern = r"(hujan|cerah|berawan|storm|cloudy|rainy|sunny)"

    # Search time in question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search activity in question
    activity_match = re.search(activity_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default values
    time = "today"
    activity = None

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()
    
    if activity_match:
        activity = activity_match.group(1).lower()

    # Calculate target date
    target_date = datetime.now()
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    location = location_from_input

    # Print extracted info
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Print activity info
    if activity:
        print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
    else:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Call function to visualize weather
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
Explanation:
•	activity_pattern is the regex pattern used to find weather-related activity words such as "hujan" (rain), "cerah" (sunny), "berawan" (cloudy), etc.
•	activity_match checks if any activity word is present in the question.
•	If found, the matched activity word is stored in the variable activity. Otherwise, activity remains None.
•	The program prints the found activity or "No specific activity mentioned" if none is found.

3.	Me: No i mean, activities such as outdoor (run, swim, sports, tennis, gardening) or indoor (cooking, reading, studying) 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! You're referring to activities like outdoor activities (e.g., running, swimming, sports) or indoor activities (e.g., cooking, reading, studying) rather than weather-related activities.
To detect such activities in the user input, you can create a list of activity keywords for both indoor and outdoor activities and then use regular expressions to search for them in the user's question.
Here's how you can modify your code to detect indoor and outdoor activities based on user input:
Modified Code to Detect Activities (Outdoor/Indoor):
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"
    
    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for outdoor activity
    outdoor_match = re.search(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for indoor activity
    indoor_match = re.search(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"
    activity = None  # Default no activity found
    activity_type = None  # Default no activity type found

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Extract time (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)
    
    if outdoor_match:
        activity = outdoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Outdoor"
    elif indoor_match:
        activity = indoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Indoor"

    # Calculate target date based on time
    target_date = datetime.now()
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the previously input location
    location = location_from_input

    # Display extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Display found activity and its type
    if activity:
        print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
        print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    else:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Call function to display weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

Explanation:
Indoor and Outdoor Activity Lists:
•	Outdoor activities are those done outside, such as running, swimming, sports, tennis, cycling, hiking, etc.
•	Indoor activities are those done inside, such as cooking, reading, studying, watching movies, etc.
Activity Detection:
•	Uses regex patterns to match outdoor and indoor activities mentioned in the user’s question.
•	If an outdoor activity is found, it stores the activity and marks its type as "Outdoor."
•	If an indoor activity is found, it stores the activity and marks its type as "Indoor."
Output:
•	The program displays the detected activity along with the targeted time and date, and the location for the weather.
•	If no activity is found, it outputs "No specific activity mentioned."

4.	Me: Hey, from that function, I notice that I can't input two activities. How do I input two user activities?
ChatGPT said:
To allow users to input multiple activities (e.g., both indoor and outdoor activities), you need to modify the function to support detecting multiple activities at once. You can use findall from the re module to find all matches for both outdoor and indoor activities in the question, rather than just finding the first one with search.
Here's how you can modify your code to handle multiple activities:
Modified Code to Handle Multiple Activities:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after-tomorrow)"
    
    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Find all outdoor activities mentioned
    outdoor_matches = re.findall(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Find all indoor activities mentioned
    indoor_matches = re.findall(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"
    activities = []       # Store found activities
    activity_types = []   # Store activity types (indoor or outdoor)

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    # Add found outdoor activities
    if outdoor_matches:
        activities.extend(outdoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Outdoor"] * len(outdoor_matches))

    # Add found indoor activities
    if indoor_matches:
        activities.extend(indoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Indoor"] * len(indoor_matches))

    # Calculate target date based on time
    target_date = datetime.now()
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "after-tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the location provided earlier
    location = location_from_input

    # Print extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Print all found activities and their types
    if activities:
        for activity, activity_type in zip(activities, activity_types):
            print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
            print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    else:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Call function to display weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

Explanation:
Using findall to find all activities:
re.findall is used to find all matches of outdoor and indoor activities in the user input.
outdoor_matches will contain a list of all found outdoor activities, and indoor_matches will contain a list of all found indoor activities.
Storing all activities and their types:
activities is a list that stores all found activities (both indoor and outdoor).
activity_types stores the corresponding type ("Outdoor" or "Indoor") for each activity found.
Displaying all found activities:
Using zip to pair each activity with its type, then printing each activity and its type.

***Conversation about error-handling in dictionary for parse_weather_question***

5.	Me: Okay. But what if the user input some activities that doesn't exist in the dictionary? How to do the error-handling?
ChatGPT said:
Good question! To handle situations where the user inputs activities that aren't part of the predefined dictionary (outdoor or indoor activities), you can add an error-handling mechanism that checks for any activities that don't match the regular expression patterns. If any activities don't match the list, we can report them as "unknown activities" and inform the user.
Here's how you can modify your code to handle activities that don't exist in the dictionary:

    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

Explanation:
Detecting Unknown Activities:
The code uses re.findall(r"\b\w+\b", question) to extract all words from the user's input, including words that are not part of the predefined activity lists.
It then checks each word to see if it exists in the known activity lists (outdoor + indoor). Words not found in those lists are stored in unknown_activities.
Displaying Unknown Activities:
If there are words not recognized as activities, the program prints these unknown words, informing the user that some words were not categorized as known indoor or outdoor activities.
Known vs Unknown Activity Check:
•	If unknown activities are found, they are printed after listing valid activities.
•	If neither known nor unknown activities are found, the program prints "No specific activity mentioned."

6.	Me: Hey apparently i dont understand the use of r in this code? outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
ChatGPT said:
Great question! The r prefix in Python is used to define a raw string literal.
In Python, a raw string literal means that special characters (like backslashes \) are treated literally and not as escape characters. This is useful when working with regular expressions (regex) or file paths, where backslashes are commonly used.
What is the r Prefix?
•	Raw String (r): When you prefix a string with r (e.g., r"..."), Python treats the string as raw and does not interpret escape sequences (like \n for newlines or \t for tabs).
•	Regular String (""): Without the r prefix, Python will interpret escape sequences (e.g., \n becomes a newline).
Why Use r in Regular Expressions?
In regular expressions, backslashes are often used (for example, \b for word boundaries or \\ for a literal backslash), so using a raw string helps avoid confusion and keeps your code clean.
Example Without r:
Without the raw string, you'd need to escape the backslash twice (\\):
pattern = "(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)" 
This works, but it's often cumbersome when you have multiple backslashes, especially in regex.
Example With r:
When you use r (raw string), Python does not treat backslashes as escape characters:
pattern = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
This makes the string easier to read and manage, especially with complex regular expressions where escape sequences are common.
# Without raw string (escaped backslashes)
regex1 = "(\\d{3})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{4})"  # for example, matching a phone number format

# With raw string (no escaping)
regex2 = r"(\d{3})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})"  # much cleaner!
In this case, using r isn't strictly necessary because your regex doesn't contain any backslashes, but it's a good habit to use it when working with regular expressions in general.
TL;DR:
•	The r in r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)" indicates a raw string where backslashes are treated literally.
•	This is useful when working with regex to avoid the need to escape special characters.

7.	Me: can you make a change in this function? if time == "tomorrow": target_date += timedelta(days=1) elif time == "after-tomorrow": target_date += timedelta(days=2)
ChatGPT said:
Sure! If you want to make a change to this part of the function, here are a couple of things you might want to adjust:
1.	Using "after tomorrow" and "day after tomorrow": You may want to handle both "after-tomorrow" and "day after tomorrow" in a single condition.
2.	Generalize the logic: You could simplify or modify the logic depending on what you want to achieve.
Here’s an improved version of that part of the code:
1.	Handling "tomorrow", "after-tomorrow", and "day after tomorrow":
if time == "tomorrow":
    target_date += timedelta(days=1)
elif time in ["after-tomorrow", "day after tomorrow"]:
    target_date += timedelta(days=2)
Explanation:
•	I replaced the elif statement with a condition that checks if time is either "after-tomorrow" or "day after tomorrow". This makes the code cleaner and handles both cases in a single condition.
2.	If you'd like to generalize the logic further or handle more variations, you could do something like this:
time_map = {
    "today": 0,
    "tomorrow": 1,
    "after-tomorrow": 2,
    "day after tomorrow": 2
}

# Check if the time is in the map and adjust the date accordingly
if time in time_map:
    target_date += timedelta(days=time_map[time])
Explanation:
•	time_map is a dictionary that maps time phrases like "today", "tomorrow", "after-tomorrow", and "day after tomorrow" to the corresponding number of days to add.
•	This way, you can easily extend the code to handle additional time-related phrases without cluttering the logic with multiple if-elif conditions.
Final Adjusted Code:
if time in time_map:
    target_date += timedelta(days=time_map[time])

8.	Me: Hey, I just realised that when a user types any time pattern, the program shows the whole time pattern. How to show the visualisation only based on what the time pattern is desired by the user. This is my code: 🤖: Hi! What activities would you like to do in Perth, and when (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow): Gardening day after tomorrow Location: Perth Time: Day after tomorrow Target Date: Friday, 16 May 2025 Activity: Gardening Activity Type: Outdoor ===== TEMPERATURE INFORMATION FOR PERTH ===== Date: Wednesday, 14 May 2025 Current Weather: ☀️Clear Current Temperature: 19°C Minimum Temperature: 14°C Maximum Temperature: 24°C Average Temperature: 19.0°C === FORECAST FOR NEXT 3 DAYS === Date: Thursday, 15 May Weather: ☀️ Sunny Minimum Temperature: 16°C Maximum Temperature: 24°C Average Temperature: 19.0°C Date: Friday, 16 May Weather: ☀️ Sunny Minimum Temperature: 16°C Maximum Temperature: 24°C Average Temperature: 19.0°C
ChatGPT said:
I see! It looks like your program is showing the weather visualization for the entire time period rather than only for the desired day based on the user's input. To fix this, you'll need to ensure that the weather data is displayed only for the target date (which corresponds to the time input, like "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow").
Solution:
1.	Ensure the Target Date is Properly Calculated:
You are already calculating the target_date based on the user's input (e.g., "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow"). This is great, but you'll need to ensure the weather visualization only corresponds to this date.
2.	Fetch the Weather Data for the Target Date:
Instead of showing the weather data for the next 3 days or for all days, you should adjust your create_temperature_visualisation() function (or its equivalent) to fetch and display the weather only for the calculated target_date.
3.	Modify the Logic to Only Visualize for the Desired Date:
Here's how you can adjust the code to only display the weather for the target_date.
Updated Code:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Updated time_pattern regex to match "after tomorrow" correctly
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after[-\s]?tomorrow|day[-\s]?after[-\s]?tomorrow)"

    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"
    
    # Cari waktu dalam pertanyaan
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Cari semua aktivitas outdoor dan indoor
    outdoor_matches = re.findall(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    indoor_matches = re.findall(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default waktu ke "today" jika tidak ditemukan
    time = "today"
    activities = []  # Menyimpan aktivitas yang ditemukan
    activity_types = []  # Menyimpan jenis aktivitas (indoor atau outdoor)
    unknown_activities = []  # Menyimpan aktivitas yang tidak dikenal

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Ambil waktu (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)

    # Tentukan tanggal berdasarkan waktu yang disebutkan
    target_date = datetime.now()

    # Adjust the date based on the recognized time
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time in ["after tomorrow", "day after tomorrow"]:
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Tambahkan aktivitas outdoor yang ditemukan
    if outdoor_matches:
        activities.extend(outdoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Outdoor"] * len(outdoor_matches))

    # Tambahkan aktivitas indoor yang ditemukan
    if indoor_matches:
        activities.extend(indoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Indoor"] * len(indoor_matches))

    # Periksa aktivitas yang tidak ada dalam daftar (aktivitas yang tidak terdeteksi oleh regex)
    all_activities_in_question = re.findall(r"\b\w+\b", question)  # Ambil semua kata dalam pertanyaan
    known_activities = set(outdoor_matches + indoor_matches)
    
    # Cari kata-kata yang tidak ada dalam known_activities
    unknown_activities = [activity for activity in all_activities_in_question if activity.lower() not in known_activities]

    # Tampilkan hasil ekstraksi
    print(f"Location: {location_from_input}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Tampilkan aktivitas yang ditemukan dan jenisnya
    if activities:
        for activity, activity_type in zip(activities, activity_types):
            print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
            print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    
    # Tampilkan aktivitas yang tidak dikenal
    if unknown_activities:
        print(f"Unknown activities: {', '.join(unknown_activities)}")
    
    if not activities and not unknown_activities:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Fetch and show weather data for the specific target date
    if location_from_input:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location_from_input, target_date)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date):
    # Simulate fetching weather data for the specific target date
    print("\n===== TEMPERATURE INFORMATION FOR", location.upper(), "=====")
    print(f"Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    print("Current Weather: ☀️Clear")
    print("Current Temperature: 19°C")
    print("Minimum Temperature: 14°C")
    print("Maximum Temperature: 24°C")
    print("Average Temperature: 19.0°C")
    
    # Simulate a 3-day forecast based on the target date
    print("\n=== FORECAST FOR NEXT 3 DAYS ===")
    forecast_dates = [target_date + timedelta(days=1), target_date + timedelta(days=2), target_date + timedelta(days=3)]
    
    for i, forecast_date in enumerate(forecast_dates):
        print(f"\nDate: {forecast_date.strftime('%A, %d %B')}")
        print("Weather: ☀️ Sunny")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: 16°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: 24°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: 19.0°C")
Changes:
1.	Updated create_temperature_visualisation():
o	Now, it accepts target_date as a parameter and will fetch/display the weather information based on this specific date, not a static date or the entire forecast period.
o	The weather visualization now only displays information for the target_date (e.g., "today", "tomorrow", "after tomorrow").
2.	Main Function (parse_weather_question()):
o	After the time (target_date) is calculated based on user input, the program calls create_temperature_visualisation(location_from_input, target_date) to display the weather information for that specific date.
3.	Simulated Weather Data:
o	In the create_temperature_visualisation(), the weather is simulated to show the current weather for the target_date and the forecast for the next 3 days based on that date. 
Conclusion:
o	Now, the weather information (visualization) will only be shown for the target_date as determined by the user's input (e.g., "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow"). The forecast for the next 3 days will still be displayed, but only starting from the target_date.

ChatGPT said:
The error you're seeing, NameError: name 'day' is not defined, indicates that somewhere in the create_temperature_visualisation function, you're trying to reference a variable called day that hasn't been defined or initialized.
This usually happens when you're trying to access elements of a dictionary or list without properly iterating over it or assigning values to it.
Fixing the Error:
To help you more effectively, let's review the part of your code that involves referencing day. Since you haven’t shared the full code of create_temperature_visualisation(), I’ll assume the error happens when you are looping over some data or trying to process a forecast. You might be trying to access the data in the wrong way.
Here’s how you can resolve the issue:
1.	Ensure you're iterating over the correct object: If you're dealing with a list of days (for the forecast), make sure that you loop through the data correctly.
2.	Correct Usage of a Forecast Array or Dictionary: If you're fetching forecast data for the next few days, make sure that you're accessing the day correctly by ensuring it's part of the list or dictionary.
Here is a more complete, corrected version based on the likely scenario:
Updated create_temperature_visualisation() Function:

ChatGPT said:
Key Changes:
1.	Accessing Forecast Data Correctly (Fixing NameError with day):
o	In the original code, you had an issue with the day variable not being defined properly. The corrected version ensures that we are referencing the correct data from weather_data['weather'].
2.	Skipping Today's Forecast:
o	The original code didn’t account for skipping the forecast for "today," which was already displayed earlier in the code. Now, we properly skip the first forecast entry.
Highlighted Code Changes:
# Show forecast for next few days
for i, forecast_date in enumerate(forecast_dates):
    if i == 0:  # Skip today as we already showed it
        continue

    # Correct way to reference the forecast data
    day = weather_data['weather'][i + 1]  # Skipping the first entry because it's for today

    date_str = day['date']
    date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
    formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")

    min_temp = int(day['mintempC'])
    max_temp = int(day['maxtempC'])
    avg_temp = int(day['avgtempC'])
    weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day weather

    weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc) # TO CALL WEATHER EMOJI FUNCTION
    print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
    print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
    print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
    print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
    print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
Detailed Explanation of the Changes:
1.	Accessing day Correctly:
o	Before: You were trying to reference day['date'] without defining day in the loop. This caused the NameError because day was not available in the scope of the loop.
o	After: Now we correctly reference the forecast data for each day using:
day = weather_data['weather'][i + 1]  # Skipping the first entry because it's for today
2.	Skipping Today's Forecast:
o	Before: The first entry in the weather_data['weather'] was for "today", which was also being processed in the loop for the next days.
o	After: We skip the first entry (i == 0) because we've already displayed today's weather earlier in the function. This prevents duplicating the weather information for today.
Summary of Key Fixes:
•	Correcting Access to the Forecast Data: The key change was to make sure day was properly defined by referencing the correct index in the weather_data['weather'] list.
•	Skipping Today's Forecast: We ensured that today's forecast is not displayed again in the loop for the next days.

***Conversation about an error in create_temperature_visualization ***

11.	Me: There's still an error IndexError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-24-f4037bfbe186> in <cell line: 0>() 39 print("=" * 53) 40 ---> 41 main() 2 frames <ipython-input-22-d7f16ac4d9f1> in create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date) 100 if i == 0: # Skip today as we already showed it 101 continue --> 102 day = weather_data['weather'][i + 1] 103 104 date_str = day['date'] IndexError: list index out of range
ChatGPT said:
The IndexError: list index out of range occurs when you attempt to access an index that doesn't exist in the list. Specifically, in this line:
day = weather_data['weather'][i + 1]
The error indicates that weather_data['weather'] doesn't have enough elements to support i + 1. This likely happens because the weather_data['weather'] list doesn't contain enough entries (it might only have one entry for today, for example), and you're trying to access an index that doesn't exist.
Solution:
•	Ensure Weather Data Contains Enough Forecasts:
Before accessing weather_data['weather'][i + 1], make sure the weather_data['weather'] contains at least i + 1 elements. You can add a check to see if the list has enough elements before attempting to access them.
•	Handle Missing Forecast Data:
If the weather_data only has a forecast for today, we should handle the case where there is no additional forecast data available (i.e., for tomorrow, or after tomorrow).
Fix:
Here’s how you can modify the loop to prevent the IndexError:
# Show forecast for next few days
for i, forecast_date in enumerate(forecast_dates):
    if i == 0:  # Skip today as we already showed it
        continue

    # Check if there is enough data for the forecast days
    if i + 1 < len(weather_data['weather']):
        # Correct way to reference the forecast data
        day = weather_data['weather'][i + 1]  # Skipping the first entry because it's for today

        date_str = day['date']
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")

        min_temp = int(day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = int(day['avgtempC'])
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day weather

        weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc) # TO CALL WEATHER EMOJI FUNCTION
        print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    else:
        print(f"\nNo forecast available for {forecast_date.strftime('%A, %d %B')}")
Explanation:
Check if Data Exists:
The line:
if i + 1 < len(weather_data['weather']):
ensures that you're only trying to access a forecast day if i + 1 is a valid index in the weather_data['weather'] list. This prevents accessing an index out of range.
Handle Missing Data:
•	If the forecast data doesn't exist for the requested days, the code now prints a message like:
print(f"\nNo forecast available for {forecast_date.strftime('%A, %d %B')}")
This will inform the user that there is no forecast available for that particular day.
Example:
If the weather_data['weather'] contains only 1 entry (for today), but you're trying to access data for the next two days, it will output something like:
No forecast available for Thursday, 15 May
No forecast available for Friday, 16 May
Conclusion:
By adding a check to ensure that the forecast data exists for the next days and handling cases where the data is missing, the IndexError will be prevented. This will allow the program to continue smoothly even if there are fewer forecast entries than expected.

ChatGPT said:
It looks like the issue you're experiencing is due to the calculation of the target_date when handling inputs like "today" and "tomorrow". The date for "today" is being incorrectly calculated, which is why the weather information is being displayed for the day after tomorrow instead of today.

The issue is likely happening because of how you're setting target_date based on the time input.

Problem:
The target_date is being set using datetime.now(), but you're not correctly handling how today and tomorrow are calculated. Specifically, when you use "today", it might still be using a wrong date due to timezone issues, or datetime.now() might not be aligning with your expectations for "today".

Solution:
We need to ensure that:

today is set to the current date (without any changes).

tomorrow should be today + 1 day.

after-tomorrow should be today + 2 days.

Fixing the Code:
We can adjust how the target_date is set to make sure that "today", "tomorrow", and "after-tomorrow" are calculated correctly.

Here is the corrected part of your code:

Updated Code to Fix the Issue:
def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):

Key Fixes:
1.	Using datetime.now().date():
o	Instead of using datetime.now() to get the current time (which includes the time component), we now use datetime.now().date() to extract only the date, ignoring the time. This ensures that "today" refers to the current date and doesn't include any time-related discrepancies.
2.	Handling tomorrow and after-tomorrow:
o	tomorrow is now calculated as target_date + timedelta(days=1), which means the next day.
o	after-tomorrow is handled as target_date + timedelta(days=2), which is two days after the current date.

ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see! The issue is likely due to the way we're calculating the target_date for "today", "tomorrow", and "after-tomorrow". The logic in the code is correctly handling the target_date, but it seems that the forecast data you're receiving may not match the day you're expecting, or there's a misunderstanding about how the days are being calculated.
Explanation of the Issue:
•	When the user enters "today", the program should show the forecast for today.
•	When the user enters "tomorrow", the program should show the forecast for tomorrow.
•	When the user enters "after-tomorrow", the program should show the forecast for the day after tomorrow.
However, in your case, the program still shows the forecast for the day after tomorrow even when the user selects today or tomorrow.
The Solution:
•	The target_date needs to be set correctly for today, tomorrow, and after-tomorrow, and we should also ensure that when calling the weather data, we are referencing the correct date.
Let's re-examine and fix the issue in the code so it always picks the correct forecast for the requested date.
What We Need to Do:
1.	For "today", the target_date should be the current date (but without the time component).
2.	For "tomorrow", it should be the date 1 day from today.
3.	For "after-tomorrow", it should be the date 2 days from today.
Additionally, we need to make sure that when we fetch the forecast data, we align it with the target date that the user selected.

ChatGPT said:
The issue in your function appears to be related to incorrect handling of the target date calculation, especially when dealing with inputs like "today", "tomorrow", and "after tomorrow". From the current logic, it seems that your function doesn't properly address the time zone differences or mismatched expectations for "today" (it might not be aligning with the actual current date).
The Problems:
1.	Target Date Calculation: The code is using datetime.now().date(), but depending on the time of day when you run the function, it might not match the exact date the user intends. For example, if it's late at night and the user requests "today", the program might still show tomorrow's forecast.
2.	Using the Date Without Time: You're calculating target_date using only the date (.date()), but you might need to adjust the calculation to better align with user expectations.
3.	Weather Fetching Logic: You may be receiving the forecast data for all days ahead, but if the data returned doesn't exactly match the target_date, it might show an incorrect date.
Solution:
1.	Accurate Target Date Calculation:
o	Ensure that "today" is the current date, "tomorrow" is the next day, and "after tomorrow" is 2 days ahead.
o	Use datetime.now() properly to calculate the target date based on time of day to avoid mismatches.
2.	Ensure Correct Matching of Dates in Forecast:
o	Make sure that when fetching weather data, you're matching it to the correct date, i.e., target_date.

    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
Key Changes:
1.	Using .replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0):
o	This ensures that the target_date is set to midnight for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, ensuring the correct date without any time component.
o	We remove any time of day so that "today" is the current date, "tomorrow" is exactly 24 hours from now, and "after tomorrow" is exactly 48 hours from now.
2.	Accurate Date Adjustments:
o	For "tomorrow" and "after-tomorrow", the code calculates the date and resets the time part to midnight to avoid issues with the current time affecting the comparison.
15.	Me: Hey, I still got the wrong output. I don't want all days to be displayed, only to show what day the users want, please.
ChatGPT said:
Based on the issue you're facing, you mentioned that you are getting weather data for all the days even when the user requests only a specific day (e.g., "today", "tomorrow", "after-tomorrow").
Key Problem:
In your current code, you are calculating a forecast_dates list that contains the next three days (after the target_date). But you want to show only the weather for the requested day (i.e., "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow"), not for all the next days.
Solution:
1.	Remove the loop that iterates through all forecast days: Since the user only wants one day, we don't need to display weather for multiple days.
2.	Display weather for only the target date: Fetch and show weather data only for the target_date that was calculated based on user input (today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow).
Revised create_temperature_visualisation Function:
Let's update the create_temperature_visualisation function so that it displays weather for only the target_date:
def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date):
    # Import needed at the top of your file

    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return

    # Simulate a 3-day forecast based on the target date
    print("\n=== WEATHER CONDITION ===")
    
    # Look for the weather data for the specific target_date
    matching_day = None
    for day in weather_data["weather"]:
        day_date = datetime.strptime(day["date"], "%Y-%m-%d").date()  # Convert to date object
        if day_date == target_date:
            matching_day = day
            break
    
    if matching_day:
        # Extract weather conditions for the matching day
        min_temp = int(matching_day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(matching_day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = int(matching_day['avgtempC'])
        weather_desc = matching_day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day weather
        
        weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc)  # TO CALL WEATHER EMOJI FUNCTION
        
        print(f"\nDate: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    else:
        print(f"No weather data available for {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    print("\n" + "=" * 50)
Key Changes:
1.	Removed the loop that iterates over all forecast days:
o	Now, instead of showing weather for the next 3 days, we only look for the weather data that matches the target_date.
o	If the target date matches a date in the weather_data, we proceed to display that day’s weather.
2.	Displaying only the target day’s weather:
o	We search through the weather data and match the date (day_date == target_date). If a match is found, we display the weather for that day.
3.	Handling the case when no matching weather data is found:
o	If no weather data is available for the target date, we inform the user that there is no forecast available for that specific day:
print(f"No weather data available for {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
Example Output:
Input:
question = "What activities would you like to do in Japan, and when (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow): Gardening today"
location_from_input = "Japan"
parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input)
Expected Output:
Location: Japan
Time: Today
Target Date: Wednesday, 14 May 2025
Activity: Gardening
Activity Type: Outdoor

=== WEATHER CONDITION ===

Date: Wednesday, 14 May 2025
Weather: ☀️ Sunny
Minimum Temperature: 12°C
Maximum Temperature: 23°C
Average Temperature: 17.0°C

Conclusion:
With this update, the function now only shows the weather for the requested day, whether it’s today, tomorrow, or after tomorrow. If no forecast data is available for the target date, the function will inform the user that no weather data is available for that specific date.
17.	Me: I only want to print the forecast for the day mentioned.
Because the input was "running today", it means the weather should only be displayed for today.

To display only today's weather (as in the case of "running today"), you just need to take the first entry from weather_data['weather'] (usually index 0), then print it like this:
from datetime import datetime

# … previous code to fetch weather_data, target_date, etc. …

print("\n=== WEATHER CONDITION ===")

# Get today's weather data
today_data = weather_data['weather'][0]

# Parse the date
date_str = today_data['date']
date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")

# Extract weather conditions
min_temp = int(today_data['mintempC'])
max_temp = int(today_data['maxtempC'])
avg_temp = int(today_data['avgtempC'])
weather_desc = today_data['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # index 4 = midday

# Add emoji
weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc)

# Print only today's weather
print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")

Explanation of the changes:
•	Removed the 3-day loop (forecast_dates and for loop) because we only need the first entry ([0]), which represents today's weather.
•	Ensured the date is properly formatted and the correct hourly element is accessed to get the midday weather condition.
•	This way, when the activity is "running today", the program will display only today's weather.

If you want to support "today", "tomorrow", and "day after tomorrow":
Add an optional parameter days_ahead=0, then use:
day = weather_data['weather'][days_ahead]
Example calls:
create_temperature_visualisation("Perth", target_date, days_ahead=0)  # today
create_temperature_visualisation("Perth", target_date, days_ahead=1)  # tomorrow

✅ Solution: Small modifications in two parts
1. Add days_ahead parameter to create_temperature_visualisation
Change the function to this:
def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date, days_ahead=0):
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return

    print("\n=== WEATHER CONDITION ===")

    if days_ahead < len(weather_data['weather']):
        day = weather_data['weather'][days_ahead]  # Get weather for the specified day
        date_str = day['date']
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")

        min_temp = int(day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = int(day['avgtempC'])
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
        weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc)

        print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    else:
        print(f"\nNo weather forecast available for {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B')}")

    print("\n" + "=" * 50)
2. Update the call in parse_weather_question
Add logic for days_ahead like this:
# Determine target_date and days_ahead based on the specified time
target_date = datetime.now()
days_ahead = 0

if time == "today":
    days_ahead = 0
elif time == "tomorrow":
    days_ahead = 1
    target_date += timedelta(days=1)
elif time in ["after tomorrow", "day after tomorrow"]:
    days_ahead = 2
    target_date += timedelta(days=2)

target_date = target_date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
Then call the function like this:
if location:
    create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date, days_ahead)

19.	Me: It’s still an error. Can you please make another fix code?
ChatGPT said:
This error occurs because you may have accidentally compared target_date (which is of type datetime.datetime) with an int, for example in this part of the create_temperature_visualisation function:
if days_ahead < len(weather_data['weather']):  # ✅ Correct
But if you accidentally wrote something like:
if target_date < len(weather_data['weather']):  # ❌ WRONG
Then Python will throw an error like:
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'datetime.datetime' and 'int'

✅ Solution:
Make sure you are comparing days_ahead (not target_date) when selecting the weather data:
if days_ahead < len(weather_data['weather']):  # ✅ CORRECT
    day = weather_data['weather'][days_ahead]
    ...
🔎 Summary: What you should check
Make sure the variables being compared are of matching types:
•	datetime compared with datetime
•	int compared with int
Double-check the line that caused the error, and make sure you haven’t written something like:
if target_date < len(weather_data['weather']):  # ❌ WRONG

20.	Me: Is it possible to do this without using an additional days_ahead parameter?
ChatGPT said:
Yes, it's absolutely possible to avoid using the additional days_ahead parameter.
You can simply compare target_date with the dates inside weather_data['weather'], and then select the weather data that matches the target date.

✅ Solution without days_ahead: Direct date matching
Update the create_temperature_visualisation function like this:
def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date):
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return

    print("\n=== WEATHER CONDITION ===")

    # Format target_date to string YYYY-MM-DD (to match the format from the API)
    target_date_str = target_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    # Search for the weather data that matches the target date
    matched_day = None
    for day in weather_data['weather']:
        if day['date'] == target_date_str:
            matched_day = day
            break

    if matched_day:
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(matched_day['date'], "%Y-%m-%d")
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")

        min_temp = int(matched_day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(matched_day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = int(matched_day['avgtempC'])
        weather_desc = matched_day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
        weather_emoji = get_weather_emoji(weather_desc)

        print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_emoji} {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    else:
        print(f"No weather forecast available for {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B')}")

    print("\n" + "=" * 50)
🎯 Advantages of this approach:
•	More robust: It does not rely on the order of weather_data['weather'].
•	Clearer logic: It only searches for the exact date mentioned.
•	No need to calculate days_ahead.
If you already use this approach, then your parse_weather_question() function can stay as it is—no major changes are needed—since target_date is still used normally.

Day 5 - 16/05/2025
***Conversation about generate_weather_response***

1.	Me: Based on this
🤖: Hi! What activities would you like to do in Perth, and when (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow): run today Location: Perth Time: Today Target Date: Wednesday, 14 May 2025 Activity: Run Activity Type: Outdoor === WEATHER CONDITION === Date: Wednesday, 14 May Weather: ☀️ Sunny Minimum Temperature: 14°C Maximum Temperature: 24°C Average Temperature: 19.0°C
Can I make activities suggestions? How do I integrate with that code?
How do I create a response in Python using a generate_weather_response() function for the output?
This is my code for parsing the question:
def parse_weather_question(question, location):
    # Define a regex pattern to detect time expressions
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after[-\s]?tomorrow|day[-\s]?after[-\s]?tomorrow)"

    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping|skiing|sailing|kayaking|gardening)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"

    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Search for all outdoor activities
    outdoor_matches = re.findall(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for all indoor activities
    indoor_matches = re.findall(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time is "today" if no match found
    time = "today"
    activities = []        # Stores the found activities
    activity_types = []    # Stores the activity types (indoor or outdoor)

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Get the time value (today, tomorrow, etc.)

    # Add any found outdoor activities
    if outdoor_matches:
        activities.extend(outdoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Outdoor"] * len(outdoor_matches))

    # Add any found indoor activities
    if indoor_matches:
        activities.extend(indoor_matches)
        activity_types.extend(["Indoor"] * len(indoor_matches))

    # Determine the target date based on the detected time
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "today":
        target_date = target_date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    elif time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
        target_date = target_date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
    elif time in ["after tomorrow", "day after tomorrow"]:
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)
        target_date = target_date.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

    # Display the extracted values
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

    # Display the detected activities and their types
    if activities:
        for activity, activity_type in zip(activities, activity_types):
            print(f"Activity: {activity.capitalize()}")
            print(f"Activity Type: {activity_type}")
    else:
        print("No specific activity mentioned.")

    # Call the function to display weather for the given location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

ChatGPT said:
To generate a natural response like that in Python, you can create a function named generate_weather_response() that takes parameters such as location, date, activity type, and weather data, then returns a suggested message based on the weather conditions.
Here is an example implementation:
✅ Step-by-Step Integration Plan:
1.	Modify create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date) to return weather data instead of (or in addition to) just visualizing it.
2.	Call generate_weather_response() with the parsed data and the returned weather info.
3.	Print or return the full response.
________________________________________
🛠️ Step 1: Update create_temperature_visualisation()
Ensure this function returns a dictionary like:
{
    "date": "Wednesday, 14 May",
    "weather": "☀️ Sunny",
    "min_temp": 14,
    "max_temp": 24,
    "avg_temp": 19.0
}
If it currently only visualizes, modify it to optionally return data:
def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date, return_data=False):
    # Fetch and parse weather data here...
    weather_data = {
        "date": target_date.strftime("%A, %d %B"),
        "weather": "☀️ Sunny",  # Example
        "min_temp": 14,
        "max_temp": 24,
        "avg_temp": 19.0
    }

    if return_data:
        return weather_data

    # Optional: Display chart/visual here if not returning data

🛠️ Step 2: Modify parse_weather_question() to use generate_weather_response()
Replace the print block inside the if location: section with:
     # Get weather data
    if location:
        weather = create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date, return_data=True)

        if activities:
            for activity, activity_type in zip(activities, activity_types):
                response = generate_weather_response(
                    location=location,
                    date_str=target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y'),
                    activity=activity,
                    weather_desc=weather['weather'],
                    min_temp=weather['min_temp'],
                    max_temp=weather['max_temp'],
                    avg_temp=weather['avg_temp']
                )
                print(response)
        else:
            print("No specific activity mentioned.")
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")
2.	Me: Now I want to add other conditions to the suggestion results. Can you please show me how?
ChatGPT said:
Sure! To add other conditions to the suggestion results, you can extend the logic inside your generate_weather_response() function to include more nuanced advice based on factors such as:
•	Weather description (rain, snow, fog, etc.)
•	Temperature extremes (too cold or too hot)
•	Wind speed or humidity (if you have that data)
•	Time of day preferences or safety considerations
________________________________________
Example: Adding weather condition checks and temperature warnings
Here's how you might enhance your function with additional conditions:
def generate_weather_response(location, date_str, activity, weather_desc, min_temp, max_temp, avg_temp):
    # Base time suggestions based on average temperature
    if avg_temp <= 15:
        time_suggestion = "around 10 AM to 3 PM, when the weather is warmer"
    elif avg_temp >= 25:
        time_suggestion = "in the morning before 9 AM or in the evening after 5 PM"
    else:
        time_suggestion = "between 7 AM to 10 AM, or after 5 PM"

    # Additional condition suggestions based on weather description
    weather_desc_lower = weather_desc.lower()
    extra_advice = ""

    if "rain" in weather_desc_lower or "drizzle" in weather_desc_lower:
        extra_advice = "Don't forget to bring an umbrella or raincoat."
    elif "snow" in weather_desc_lower:
        extra_advice = "Wear warm clothes and be cautious of slippery surfaces."
    elif "fog" in weather_desc_lower or "mist" in weather_desc_lower:
        extra_advice = "Visibility may be low; please be careful when running outdoors."
    elif "thunderstorm" in weather_desc_lower:
        extra_advice = "It's safer to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms."

    # Temperature extreme warnings
    if max_temp >= 35:
        extra_advice += "\nAvoid strenuous activity during peak heat hours to prevent heatstroke."
    elif min_temp <= 5:
        extra_advice += "\nDress warmly to avoid cold-related issues."

    # Tips list (you could also make this conditional)
    tips = [
        "Stay hydrated",
        "Use sunscreen and a hat",
        "Choose shaded areas if possible",
    ]

    # Combine tips and extra advice
    if extra_advice:
        tips.append(extra_advice.strip())

    tips_text = "\n- ".join(tips)

    response = f"""
🤖 Hi! Here’s your activity suggestion:

📍 Location: {location}

🌡️ Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C
🌡️ Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C

✅ **Activity Suggestion:**
Today's weather is {weather_desc.lower()} with an average temperature of {avg_temp:.1f}°C, ideal for {activity.lower()} outdoors.
It's best to do it {time_suggestion}.

💡 Tips:

Enjoy your activity! 🚀
"""
    return response.strip()
How to Use This
Just replace your current generate_weather_response() with the above. This version adds:
•	Weather-based advice (rain, snow, fog, thunderstorm)
•	Temperature extremes warnings (hot/cold)
•	Keeps your original time suggestion logic
•	Combines all tips and advice neatly
________________________________________
If you want to add other factors like wind speed or humidity, you can pass those as additional parameters and extend the logic similarly.
3.	Me: Can you make it simple like this: if activity types = outdoor and weather = rain and average temperature < 15, then "Outdoor activities is not suggested" etc. I want to make it like this
 
ChatGPT said:
Sure! From your screenshot, I see you want a concise conditional structure that sets activity_suggestion based on weather and temperature conditions.
Here’s how you can adjust your existing generate_weather_response() (or wherever you want to put this logic) with your style and variable names. I also fix the bad_weather check for keywords, and incorporate your variables (desc, activity, activity_type, avg_temp):
def generate_weather_response(location, date_str, activity, activity_type, weather_desc, min_temp, max_temp, avg_temp):
    desc = weather_desc.lower()
    activity_suggestion = ""

    bad_weather = any(keyword in desc for keyword in ['rain', 'thunder', 'fog', 'mist', 'shower'])

    if activity_type.lower() == "outdoor":
        if bad_weather or avg_temp < 15:
            activity_suggestion = f"The weather ({weather_desc}) and quite cold outside is not suitable for {activity_type.capitalize()} - {activity.capitalize()}."
        elif 15 <= avg_temp <= 30:
            activity_suggestion = f"It's warm outside! Great time for {activity_type.capitalize()} - {activity.capitalize()}."
        else:
            activity_suggestion = "It's very hot outside."
    else:
        # For indoor activities, you can customize suggestions as needed
        activity_suggestion = f"It's a perfect day for indoor activities like {activity.capitalize()}."

    response = f"""
🤖 Hi! Here's your activity suggestion:

    return response.strip()
How to call it:
Make sure to also pass the activity_type when calling this function, e.g.:
response = generate_weather_response(

    date_str="Wednesday, 14 May 2025",
    activity="run",
    activity_type="outdoor",
    weather_desc="Light rain",

TypeError: generate_weather_response() missing 1 required positional argument: 'activity_type'
ChatGPT said:
The error message:
TypeError: generate_weather_response() missing 1 required positional argument: 'activity_type'
means that when you call generate_weather_response(), you forgot to pass the activity_type argument, which is required.
How to fix it:
In your parse_weather_question() function, you call generate_weather_response() like this:
response = generate_weather_response(
    location=location,
    date_str=target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y'),
    activity=activity,
    weather_desc=weather["weather"],
    min_temp=weather["min_temp"],
    max_temp=weather["max_temp"],
    avg_temp=weather["avg_temp"]
)
But you need to also pass the corresponding activity_type for each activity.
Since you have:
activities = [...]  # list of activity names
activity_types = [...]  # list of "Indoor" or "Outdoor" strings, aligned by index
You should loop over both together, like:
for activity, activity_type in zip(activities, activity_types):
    response = generate_weather_response(
        location=location,
        date_str=target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y'),
        activity=activity,
        activity_type=activity_type,
        weather_desc=weather["weather"],
        min_temp=weather["min_temp"],
        max_temp=weather["max_temp"],
        avg_temp=weather["avg_temp"]
    )
    print(response)
Summary:
Just add the missing activity_type=activity_type argument in your call to generate_weather_response().

5.	Me: Hi can you please make this part correct parse_weather_question(question, location):
ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Here's a corrected and complete version of your parse_weather_question() function that includes passing the activity_type when calling generate_weather_response().

Explanation:
•	Extracts activities and their types.
•	Determines the correct target date based on user input.
•	Fetches weather data with create_temperature_visualisation(..., return_data=True).
•	Calls your generate_weather_response() with all needed parameters including activity_type.
•	Prints the suggestions.
